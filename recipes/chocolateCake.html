        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round baking pans.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but this is normal.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Frost and decorate as desired before serving.</li>
